## Scraper (from JetBrains Academy)

#### Description 
Function that takes a website address and a number of webpages as input arguments and then goes all over the website saving every news article on the page to a separate .txt file on your computer.

#### Technologies used:
- *Python/BeautifulSoup/Requests*

#### Usage 
```
python scraper.py
```

### Implementation:
(The greater-than symbol followed by a space (```> ```) in examples represents the user input. It's not part of the input.)
	
- The function can take two parameters from the user input: the number of pages (an integer) and the type of articles (a string). 
- The program takes two input values from the user and then continues to process the Nature website data.
	- Example:
	```
	> 4
	> Nature Briefing
	Saved all articles.
	```
